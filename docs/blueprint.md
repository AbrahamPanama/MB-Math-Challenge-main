# **App Name**: RetoMates

## Core Features:

- Parent & Child Account Management: Allows parents to register, create and manage multiple child profiles, and link them. Children can easily select their profile to begin learning.
- Adaptive Practice Modes: Provides core learning experiences: 'Smart Practice' for personalized skill adaptation, 'Daily Mission' for mixed review, and 'Unit Boss' for mastery checks across various math subskills.
- Dynamic Problem Generation: Automatically generates diverse math problems (e.g., multiplication, addition, fractions) with varying difficulty levels based on the child's progress and the configured curriculum, ensuring a continuous supply of relevant practice items.
- Intelligent Feedback & Hints Tool: Delivers immediate, constructive feedback for each answer. It provides multi-level hints, dynamically generated to guide the child through step-by-step explanations or worked examples, without simply giving away the answer.
- Personalized Progress Dashboards: Offers engaging visual dashboards for children to see their achievements (e.g., mastered skills, levels) and recommended next steps. Parents get detailed insights into their child's mastery, common error types, and learning trends.
- Gamified Mastery System: Integrates XP points for activity, 'Stars' for skill mastery, and 'Streaks' for daily engagement, fostering motivation and celebrating progress without punitive measures.
- Adaptive Learning Engine: Utilizes machine learning principles to dynamically adjust problem difficulty, item selection, and content sequencing in real-time based on the child's performance signals (e.g., accuracy, consecutive errors), ensuring optimal challenge and guiding them through personalized learning paths.

## Style Guidelines:

- Color scheme: Light mode. The app targets young learners, and a light theme supports readability, creates a cheerful atmosphere, and minimizes eye strain during educational tasks, aligning with a confidence-building approach.
- Primary color: A friendly and energizing orange-gold (#E8912A). This hue, informed by concepts of positive engagement and youth, offers a warm, inviting feel that promotes focus and happiness without being overly childish or distracting. It contrasts clearly against the light background.
- Background color: A very subtle, warm cream (#F7F2EE). This light, desaturated hue provides a clean, calming canvas for the content, allowing interactive elements to stand out and reducing visual clutter, promoting an uncluttered UI suitable for young users.
- Accent color: A vibrant red-orange (#E54E19). This analogous hue, with increased saturation and contrast against both the primary and background colors, is ideal for drawing attention to calls-to-action, success indicators, or important alerts, injecting dynamism into the UI.
- Font: 'PT Sans' (humanist sans-serif). Selected for its modern aesthetic combined with a touch of warmth and high readability. It will be used for both headlines and body text to maintain a cohesive, clean, and easily digestible interface for young children.
- Use clear, intuitive, and stylized vector icons. Icons should be simple, easily recognizable, and communicate their function directly to children without relying heavily on text, consistent with large tap targets and an uncluttered UI.
- Prioritize a simple, uncluttered layout with large tap targets and ample white space, designed for easy navigation by young children on touch-screen devices. Information hierarchy should be clear, and distractions minimized during problem-solving.
- Implement subtle, non-distracting micro-animations for positive reinforcement (e.g., correct answers, XP gain), smooth transitions between screens, and highlighting interactive elements. Animations should be swift and serve to enhance feedback without creating visual noise.
